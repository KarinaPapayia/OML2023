# Exercise 00

<!--## Configuration of the environments-->

This exercise is to set up the different coding environments for the lecture.

## Python 

Many package managers for Python are available, including

- Conda / Miniconda
- venv module / virtualenv

We use the `venv` module in order to create our development environment. If you are comfortable with conda you probably do not need what follows. 

#### Creating the virtual environment (venv module)

Assuming you have [Python 3.8 or above installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **and** in your `PATH` variable (check it with: `python3 --version`, should be >= 3.8), clone the repository and create the virtual environment in `/path/to/OML2023/exercises`:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/katerinapapya/OML2023.git . 

cd OML2023/exercises

python3 -m venv .venv  # creates a virtual environment inside OML2023 using the module venv with name '.venv'
```

The environment will host all the different pip packages, and has the same python version as `python3`. It can be activated with

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

and deactivate with 

```bash
deactivate
```

More informations can be found [here](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv#How_to_create_a_Python_venv).

#### Installing the required packages

Once the virtual environment is created and activated (`source .venv/bin/activate` inside the `OML2023` directory), install the required packages with 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies required to the environment.

### Jupyter 

The `jupyter` package (inside the requirements) can be called with

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

to open a browser and select a notebook. Select the notebook `ex00/ex00.ipynb`. 


<!--## Numpy Tour-->

<!--Once Python and Numpy installed in the virtual environment, carry on with `ex00.pdf` to get used to the Numpy library (if you're not already).-->



<!--### Julia-->

# Exercise 00

## Configuration of the environments

This exercise is to set up the different coding environments for the lecture.

### Python 

Many package managers for Python are available, including

- Conda / Miniconda
- virtualenv
- pyenv (version manager)

We use the `virualenv` module in order to install the required packages.
Assuming you have [https://www.python.org/downloads/](Python 3.4 or above installed) **and** in your `PATH` variable (unix) or windows TODO

```bash
python3 --version  # just to check, should be >= 3.4
git clone https://github.com/katerinapapya/OML2023.git . && cd OML2023`

cd OML2023
python3 -m venv .venv  # creates a virtual environment using the module venv with name '.venv'
```

Now, the environment will host all the different pip packages, and has the same python version as `python3`. It can be activated with

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

and deactivate with 

```bash
deactivate
```
